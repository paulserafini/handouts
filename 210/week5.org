* Week #5 :conceptual:midterm:

Definitions
 - Sampling distribution
 - Standard error
 - Law of large numbers?

Questions
 - What is the difference between standard error and standard deviation?
 - Why is standard error so named?
 - Why can't we just draw a sample from the population and estimate the parameter by the sample statistic?
 - Give an example of a sampling distribution
 - What is the difference between a sampling distribution and a sampling distribution of the mean?
 - What is the difference between standard error and standard error of the mean?
 - Imagine a bowl with five bingo chips in it, numbered 1 through 5. For this "population":
   - List all 25 possible samples of size 2 (sampling with replacement)
   - Calculate the mean for every sample
   - Count the frequency of each value of the mean
   - Draw the frequency distribution as a bar plot
   - Calculate the probability of drawing a sample with:
     - A mean >= 4
     - A mean <= 2.5
     - An error of at least 1.5
