* /Z/-scores

The area between $z_1$ and $z_2$ is equal to the area above the lesser of the two minus the area above the greater of the two. The area below $z$ = 1 - (the area above it), the area below $-z$ = the area above $z$, and the area above $-z$ = 0.5 + (the area between $z$ and the mean). \newline
   
Calculate the area between the following pairs of /z/ scores:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session global :results output raw :exports results
  printq(include.answer, seeds[1])
#+END_SRC
