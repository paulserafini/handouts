* /Z/-scores

The area between $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the area above the lesser of the two minus the area above the greater of the two. The area above /-z/ is 0.5 + the area between $z$ and the mean. \\
   
Calculate the area between the following pairs of /z/ scores:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session global :results output raw :exports results
  printq(include.answer, seeds[1])
#+END_SRC
