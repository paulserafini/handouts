 #+INCLUDE: "./math/interval.org"

* Week #3 :week3:

 1. Why is the mean more sensitive to extreme scores than the median?
 2. Give a scenario in which:
    a. The median would be a better estimate than the mean
    b. The mode would be a better estimate than the median/mean
    c. It would be crucial to report the variance along with the mean
    For each, justify your example.
 3. What are we squaring in a sum of squares, and why do we do it?
    \begin{equation*}
    \Sigma[(X_i - \bar{X})^2]
    \end{equation*}
 4. In what sense is a variance a mean?
    \begin{equation*}
    \dfrac{\Sigma[(X_i - \bar{X})^2]}{n-1}
    \end{equation*}
 5. Why do we use $n - 1$ instead of $n$ in the denominator of sample variance?
 6. When would variance be equal to zero? Explain with reference the formula
 7. Is it possible to have a negative variance? Justify your answer with reference to the formula
 8. Why do we use standard deviation instead of variance?
 9. Why is the standard deviation so named?
 10. For the following data set, calculate the mode, median, mean, and standard deviation. Then, add 5 to every number in the data set and calculate again. Then, multiply every number in the data set by 2 and calculate again. What effect does adding/multiplying every score with the same number have, and why? Explain for each statistic.
     \begin{quote}
     2, 8, 1, 1, 3

* Week #4 :week4:

 1. Last week we saw that
    a. If you subtract the same number from every score, the new mean is the old mean minus that number
    b. If you divide every score by the same number, the new standard deviation is the old standard deviation divided by that number
    So if we subtract the mean from every score, and divide every score by the standard deviation, what are the new mean and standard deviation?
 2. What is the advantage of standard scores over raw scores? Give an example of a scenario in which a standard score would be a lot more meaningful than a raw score
 3. What does the height of the normal curve above a given score tell us about that score? What does the area under the curve for a given interval tell us about that interval?
 4. On the first number line below, draw bars representing the frequency distribution of the following data:
    \begin{quote}
    4, 6, 4, 3, 8
    \end{quote}
    Then, subtract the mean from each score and draw the new distribution on the second number line. Then, divide those by the standard deviation and draw them on the third number line. What does each step do to the location, spread, and shape of the distribution?

* Week #6 :week6:

 1. What are the steps in hypothesis testing? Give an example and relate each step to the concepts we've learned so far in the course (population, sample, parameter, statistic, sampling distribution of the mean, null and alternate hypotheses, critical values, etc.)
 2. Draw a null distribution and illustrate the relationship between the critical values, the rejection region, and \alpha
 3. Draw an alternate distribution and illustrate the relationship between the critical values, the rejection region, \beta, and power
